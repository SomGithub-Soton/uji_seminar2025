# Creators in Audio-visual Media: Factors Transforming Structures to Renew Discourses  
### Research Seminar for Database Management

---

## Overview
This repository supports the research seminar **"Creators in Audio-visual Media: Factors Transforming Structures to Renew Discourses"**, with a focus on database management, data analysis, and visualization.  
In addition to theoretical sessions, the repository includes practical exercises using **Microsoft Excel** and **R Shiny**. The Excel materials cover core analytical skills such as functions, conditional operations, sorting and filtering, data validation, SUMIF logic, graph creation, and Pivot Tables.  
R Shiny materials introduce how to build interactive dashboards and web-based data visualizations for research workflows.

## Excel Practice Materials
This repository includes several Excel files designed to build essential data-handling skills:

- `1_Common_functions` – Basic Excel functions and formulas  
- `2_Sort_filter` – Sorting, filtering, and data organization  
- `3_Conditional_formatting` – Data highlighting and rule-based formatting  
- `4_If_else_condition` – Logical functions and conditional structures  
- `5_Sumif` – Conditional aggregation  
- `6_Data_validation` – Dropdowns, restrictions, and structured input  
- `7_Function_1`, `7_Function_2`, `7_Function_3` – Additional function exercises  
- `8_Graphs` – Chart creation (bar, line, pie, etc.)  
- **Pivot Table Exercises** – Introduction to Pivot Tables for summarizing large datasets

## R Shiny Materials
The repository also includes R Shiny introductory examples.  
These demonstrate how to:

- Build interactive dashboards  
- Visualize data dynamically on web interfaces  
- Combine reactive elements such as inputs, filters, and real-time charts  

Shiny is used in the seminar to show how researchers can convert static analyses into interactive, publicly accessible tools.
